Hi Grader,

I did some changes of my homework. However, when I tried to 
generate .pdf version, there is an error pop-up. It said it
can't find pdflatex engine. I did install MikTex as latex 
engine and it worked well yesterday.

I will try to figure it out as soon as possible. After I 
generate the pdf file I will just upload this and leave other 
code files untouched.

If you would like to reproduce my report, please use

to view my work. 

Thanks, and sorry again for inconvenience.

Best,
Yuqian
